# Common Terminologies in Graph Thoery

Define an undirected graph with the natrual order as $G = (V,E,\sigma)$ where $V$ is the set of the vertices, $E$ is the set of edges and $\sigma$ is the natrual ordering.

- **Chordal graph**

  - A **chordal** is a path of undirected graph between two non-conescutive vertices. ("shortcut"" between two vertices")
  - A **chordal graph** referes to every cycle of length four or greater of a simple graph has a chord. (triangulated graph)

- **Chordal Completion**

  - The triangualtion result of an undirected graph, it is a chordal graph

- **Filled Graph**

  - An undirected graph $G$ is filled graph if  any two higher order neighbours of any vertex in $G$ induce an edge
    $$
    w,z\in adj^+(G) \rightarrow \{w,z\}\in E
    $$

- **Elimination order**

  - An elimination ordering $\sigma$ is a numbering of the vertices of $G$ from 1 to n.  
  - The fill-in $F_{\sigma}$, caused by the ordering $\sigma$ is the set of edges defined as: $F=\{\{w,v\}|w\neq v, \{w,v\}\neq E\}$

- **Perfect Elimination Order**

  - $\sigma$ is perfect if $F_\sigma=\phi$
  - $\sigma ^*$ is the perfect elimination order if $G=(V,E,\sigma ^*)$ is a filled graph. (Eliminate by this order wouldn't create any new chordal)
  - A graph is chordal if and only if it has a perfect elimination order

- **Complete Graph**

  - A graph is complete if all vertices are pair-wise advanct


- **Clique**

  - A clique is a subgraph of $G$ that is complete

- **Simplicial Vertex**

  - A simplicial vertex is one whose neighbours forms a clique  

- **Vertex seperator**

  - If $S$ is a subset of the vertices: $S\in V$,  $G(V\backslash S)$ is the subgraph of $G$ induced by $S$; if $G(V\backslash S)$ is disconnected, $S$ is a separator. 

- **Clique Tree**

  - A clique tree of a graph G = (V,E) is a tree which has the cliques of G as its vertices.

- **Block** (Read more from this [paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/050643350))

  - the set of minimal seperator $S\in\triangle(G)$
  - the set of connected componets w.r.t $S$: $\mathcal{C}_G(S)$
  - The component is a full component with S if every vertex of S is adjacent to some vertex of C.
  - If $C\in\mathcal{C}(S)$, $(S,C)=S\cup C$ a block associated with S
  - The block is called full if C is a full component associated with S

- The Difference between *Minimal* and *Minimum*

  >Since the problem of computing minimum triangulations is NP-hard, the related polynomially solvable problem of computing minimal triangulations became interesting, and the first algorithms for it appeared in 1976
  >
  >It should be emphasized here that the word “optimal” should not be mistaken to mean “optimum” as in some engineering literature. In terms of a set, “optimal” refers to a set property, whereas “optimum” refers to the size of the set.

- Block realisation

- Potential Maximal Clique: a potential maximal clique if there is a minimal triangulation H of G such that Ω is a maximal clique of H.
