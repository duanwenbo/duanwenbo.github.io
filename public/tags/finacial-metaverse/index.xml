      <description>&lt;p&gt;公司同事写了一本介绍金融市场与衍生品交易的书籍，面向所有非专业岗位的从业者与爱好者。于情于理于职业发展，我都应该读一遍。开此一贴，用作记录。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthetic assets surround us in our daily lives. Look around you. The number 18 token that the cloakroom girl gave you in exchange for your coat? That is a synthetic asset. Its intrinsic value is nil. It is simply a small plastic disc, too large even to insert in the anti-theft system of your supermarket’s trolley. Instead, its value is as a sign. Only imagine the drama that would accompany its loss: a brand new coat! The cloakroom girl owns the other half of the key, an identical token, with the same number 18 emblazoned in gold. She also understands the convention. The person who offers her the matching token will be handed the corresponding coat. No further explanation is required. While a small tip might change hands, this is far from compulsory. Such an example might sound trivial. An unintentional exchange cannot be ruled out if the girl has a moment of absence. In general, however, the process leaves little room for confusion. On the other hand, when synthetic assets are meant to represent classes of objects, some of which can be abstract, things can become a little more confusing (Illustration 1)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
